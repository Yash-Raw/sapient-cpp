## Code of conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive. We want this project to be welcoming to contributors at every experience level. Harassment, spam, and bad-faith arguments are not tolerated.

## License & contributor terms

SAPIENT is **dual-licensed**: **[AGPL-3.0-only](LICENSE)** or a
**[commercial license](COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md)** from OpenHorizon Labs Pvt Ltd.

Because SAPIENT is dual-licensed, contributions must be usable under **both**
licenses. By submitting a contribution (code, documentation, or other
materials), you agree that:

1. Your contribution is licensed to the project and its users under the
   **AGPL-3.0-only**; **and**
2. You grant **OpenHorizon Labs Pvt Ltd** a perpetual, worldwide,
   royalty-free, irrevocable license to also use, distribute, and **relicense
   your contribution under the commercial license** (and any future license
   terms OpenHorizon Labs offers for SAPIENT), so the project can be offered
   under the dual-license model above; **and**
3. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant this — i.e. the work is
   yours to license (or you have permission from the rights holder, such as your
   employer).

This is a lightweight inbound-licensing grant, not a copyright assignment — you
keep ownership of your contribution. New source files should carry the standard
header:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only
// Copyright (C) 2026 OpenHorizon Labs Pvt Ltd — SAPIENT: AGPL-3.0-only OR commercial (see LICENSE, NOTICE)
```

Any modified version you **distribute or run as a network service** under the
AGPL must comply with the AGPL-3.0 (including the source-disclosure obligation
for hosted use). See [`TRADEMARK.md`](TRADEMARK.md) for name/logo use — forks
must rebrand.

## Before you start

1. **Search existing issues** — someone may already be working on it.
2. **Open an issue first** for large changes (new backends, architecture rewrites, breaking API changes).
3. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per pull request is easier to review and merge.
4. **Prefer minimal diffs** — match existing style and conventions in the crate you are editing.

---

## Getting set up

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | **1.82+** | Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) — matches the workspace `rust-version` |
| Git | any recent | |
| ALSA dev headers | Linux only | `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev` — needed because `sapient-cli`'s default `audio-io` feature (live `sapient converse`) links `cpal`/ALSA. macOS/Windows need nothing extra. |
| [just](https://github.com/casey/just) | optional | Task runner — see `justfile` |

### Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SkidGod4444/sapient.git
cd sapient
cargo build --workspace
# No audio device libs / don't want the live `converse` command? Drop the
# default audio-io feature (chat/transcribe/speak/serve are unaffected):
#   cargo build -p sapient-cli --no-default-features
```

Run the CLI locally:

```bash
cargo run -p sapient-cli -- --help
cargo run -p sapient-cli -- chat <model>
```

Release binary (faster inference):

```bash
cargo build --release -p sapient-cli
./target/release/sapient --version
```

If you use `just`:

```bash
just build      # debug build
just release    # release build
just --list     # all tasks
```

## Project structure

SAPIENT is a Cargo workspace. Crates are layered from low-level primitives up to the user-facing API.

**Dependency direction (simplified):**

```
sapient-cli → sapient-generate → sapient-hub, sapient-models, sapient-tokenizers
sapient-ffi → sapient-generate   (embedding surface — same layer as the CLI)
sapient-generate → sapient-runtime → sapient-backends-cpu, sapient-io, sapient-ir
```

When adding a dependency, keep layers acyclic — lower crates must not depend on higher ones.

### Key subsystems to know before contributing

**Forward engines, not one per architecture.** `LlamaForward`, `PhiForward`, and `Gemma3Forward`
are wired to the live chat `Pipeline`. Architecture builders in `sapient-models/src/architectures/`
target the IR graph path and are **not** used during inference. Adding a new model usually means
adding (or extending) a forward engine, not an architecture builder (unless it is for the graph
path). Some variants extend an existing engine rather than fork it: **Mixtral-class sparse MoE**
lives as a per-layer `Ffn::{Dense, Moe}` branch **inside `LlamaForward`** (shared attention/KV/RoPE;
only the FFN block differs), detected by config (`ModelInfo.moe`), not `ArchType` — a Mixtral GGUF
reports arch `llama`. See the MoE section in `CLAUDE.md` for the routing math, the two GGUF expert
formats, and the CPU-only backend gate.

**Audio (speech-to-text) is a separate path.** `WhisperForward`/`AudioEngine`
(`forward/whisper.rs`) and `TranscribePipeline` (`sapient-generate`) are independent of the text
`ForwardEngine`/`Pipeline` — `sapient transcribe` never touches the chat path. The front-end lives
in `sapient-audio` (CPU log-mel via `realfft`). Two traps when editing it: the CPU
`scaled_dot_product_attention` treats `mask=None` as **causal**, so the non-causal encoder and
cross-attention must pass an explicit all-zeros mask; and Whisper needs **exact erf GELU**
(`gelu_erf`), not the tanh `gelu`. Verify with `tests/whisper_coherence.rs` (synthetic, exact) and
the ignored `transcribe_e2e.rs` (real `whisper-tiny`).

**Text-to-speech also reuses the text engine, not a new one.** `sapient speak` runs **Orpheus-3B**
(a Llama-3.2 fine-tune) on the existing `LlamaForward`/GGUF path via `Pipeline::generate_token_ids`
(a raw-token-id generation method — no detokenize), then decodes the emitted SNAC audio-codec tokens
with the pure-Rust `SnacDecoder` (`forward/snac.rs`) → 24 kHz WAV. `SpeakPipeline` lives in
`sapient-generate/src/speak.rs`. Traps when editing it: the Orpheus prompt **must include the
tokenizer's BOS** (`encode_ids(.., true)` → realized `[128259, 128000, …]`) or the speech is
fluent-but-wrong; SNAC weights come from the ungated `mlx-community/snac_24khz` mirror and need
`normalize_snac_weights` (weight_norm fold + MLX→PyTorch conv-axis swap + `.layers.` strip); and the
`mlx` config omits `latent_dim`, so the decoder derives it from the conv-in weight shape. Validate
with `tests/snac_coherence.rs` (bit-close to torch) and the **speak→transcribe round-trip**.

**Kokoro-82M TTS (the real-time path).** `sapient-models/src/forward/kokoro/` is a pure-Rust
StyleTTS2 + ISTFTNet port — *non-autoregressive*, so it runs **real-time on CPU** (unlike the
autoregressive Orpheus/SNAC). New CPU kernels (BiLSTM, `torch.istft`-equivalent STFT/iSTFT,
AdaLayerNorm, AdaIN1d, NSF source, length-regulator) live in `kokoro/ops.rs`, each unit-tested vs a
reference. Weights: run `python3 scripts/convert_kokoro_to_safetensors.py --out ~/.cache/sapient-kokoro`
once (converts the upstream `.pth` pickle → safetensors; already hosted at `sai1974dev/kokoro-82m-safetensors`),
then point `SAPIENT_KOKORO_DIR` at it for the ignored coherence tests (`kokoro/stage_tests.rs`
validate every stage vs a committed PyTorch fixture; `sapient-generate/tests/kokoro_tts_e2e.rs` is the
text→audio + RTF check). G2P is the pure-Rust `misaki-rs` (no espeak). Editing trap: the NSF source
**omits** training-time noise/random-phase for determinism, so validate by **energy-envelope/spectrogram
correlation** (≈0.99), not max_err, plus the **speak→transcribe round-trip**.

**Quantized storage.** `DType::Q4_0` and `DType::Q8_0` store raw ggml block bytes. The key
invariant is that `as_bytes()` on a quantized tensor returns exactly `byte_count(numel)` bytes.
Use `as_quant_blocks()` to iterate raw blocks and `to_f32_vec()` to dequantize. Never call
`as_bytes_mut()` on a mmap-backed tensor (undefined behavior); it is only valid on heap-allocated
buffers such as the KV cache.

**GGUF q/k RoPE permutation.** llama.cpp permutes `attn_q`/`attn_k` rows for `llama`-arch GGUFs
(ggml NORM-style RoPE). SAPIENT uses HF/NEOX RoPE, so `gguf_weights::unpermute_llama_gguf_qk`
inverts it at load — without it those models emit incoherent token-salad. Do **not** apply it to
Qwen2/Gemma GGUFs (NEOX, not permuted) or to safetensors weights (already HF layout). If you add a
GGUF architecture, check whether its llama.cpp converter permutes q/k.

**Flash-Edge attention.** `kernels/attention.rs` uses an online-softmax tiled algorithm that
never materialises the full seq_q × seq_k score matrix (O(head_dim) working memory). If you
modify attention code, do not revert to the naive materialised path.

**Q8_0 KV cache.** The KV cache is allocated as Q8_0 blocks and updated in-place via
`Tensor::as_bytes_mut()`. Each decode step writes directly into the existing allocation — there
must be no `Vec` alloc inside the decode loop. Preserve this invariant when touching `kv_cache.rs`.

**`sapient serve` vs the graph runtime.** The OpenAI-compatible server in `sapient-cli/src/server.rs`
drives the `Pipeline` API directly. The `sapient-ir`/`sapient-runtime` graph execution path is
separate and is not involved in chat completions.

### SIMD kernel dispatch pattern

All SIMD kernels in `sapient-backends-cpu/src/kernels/quant.rs` follow a three-layer pattern:

1. **Scalar fallback** — always correct, no platform assumptions, used on x86 without AVX2 and on
   non-NEON ARM.
2. **`#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]` static dispatch** — compiled unconditionally on aarch64
   (all Apple M-series, Raspberry Pi 64-bit). Uses `std::arch::aarch64::*` intrinsics. No runtime
   check needed because all aarch64 targets have NEON.
3. **`#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]` + `is_x86_feature_detected!` runtime dispatch** — AVX2+FMA
   checked at runtime. The scalar fallback handles older x86_64 CPUs automatically.

When adding a new SIMD kernel:
- Put the scalar implementation first; it is the specification.
- Gate aarch64 blocks with `#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]` (not `target_feature`).
- Use `is_x86_feature_detected!("avx2")` inside an `if` at runtime for x86_64.
- **Do not** add `-C target-cpu=native` or `target_feature = "+neon"` to `.cargo/config.toml`
  for the `aarch64-apple-darwin` target — it breaks `ring`'s compile-time const assertions on CI.

### Adaptive rayon chunking pattern

CPU kernels that parallelize over a large output dimension (e.g. `matmul_nt`, `gemv`) must use
`gemv_chunk()` rather than `par_iter_mut()` directly over individual output rows. The chunk size
targets **4 tasks per logical core** so that a 151 936-row `lm_head` produces ~(4 × cores) tasks
instead of 151 936 micro-tasks. This avoids rayon scheduler overhead dominating on large vocab
projections. When writing a new parallelised kernel, follow the `gemv_chunk()` pattern rather
than raw `par_chunks_mut` with a chunk size of 1.

## Development workflow

### 1. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-123-download-lock
```

### 2. Make your changes

- Follow existing naming, error handling (`anyhow` in binaries, `thiserror` in libraries), and import style.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same PR.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Update `README.md` if user-facing CLI or install behavior changes.

### 3. Run checks locally

```bash
just fmt-check
just clippy
just test
```

Or without `just`:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

### 4. Push and open a PR

Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`. Fill in what changed, why, and how you tested it.

---

## Testing

### Run all tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### Run tests for one crate

```bash
cargo test -p sapient-hub
cargo test -p sapient-models
cargo test -p sapient-cli
```

### Hub integration tests (network)

Some Hub tests download public models and require network + write access to `~/.cache/huggingface/`:

```bash
cargo test -p sapient-hub --test download_parallel -- --test-threads=1
```

Run serially (`--test-threads=1`) when multiple tests touch the same cached model to avoid HF cache lock conflicts.

### FFI and TypeScript SDK tests

```bash
# sapient-ffi: unit tests, plus an ignored real-model e2e (downloads `smollm2-135m-q4`)
cargo test -p sapient-ffi
cargo test -p sapient-ffi --release -- --ignored

# TypeScript SDK (Node ≥ 18): tsc build + SSE/mock-serve suites
cd sdks/typescript && npm install && npm test
```

If you change `sapient-ffi`'s exported API, regenerate and eyeball the bindings
(Swift/Kotlin are not committed; the React Native package's generated TS/C++ in
`sdks/react-native/{src,cpp}/generated` IS committed — regenerate it with
`npm run ubrn:ios` there, which also applies the `ubrn:postgen` fix-up): see
`docs/MOBILE.md` §4. The packaging scripts double
as integration tests — `./scripts/package-swift.sh --smoke` compiles and runs a
real macOS binary against the packaged XCFramework (CI runs this too), and
`./scripts/package-android.sh` verifies the `.so`'s uniffi exports. Both build
with the `wgpu` GPU feature by default (`--cpu-only` opts out); if the smoke
link fails on a new undefined symbol after a dependency change, add the
framework to BOTH the Package.swift template and the smoke `swiftc` line in
`package-swift.sh`. After repackaging, delete the consuming app's DerivedData —
Xcode does not re-link a changed xcframework at the same path. **Before
testing on a phone, read `docs/MOBILE.md` §5** — the safe-testing ladder for
personal hardware is a project rule, not a suggestion.

### Benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench -p sapient-backends-cpu
just bench
```

---

## Formatting and linting

CI enforces both. PRs that fail these checks will not merge.

```bash
cargo fmt --all              # auto-format
cargo fmt --all -- --check   # CI check (no writes)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Rules of thumb:

- No `clippy` warnings — CI uses `-D warnings`.
- Prefer `debug!` / `tracing` for internal logs; keep CLI output user-friendly unless `-v` is passed.
- Do not commit secrets (`.env`, HF tokens, API keys).

---

## Adding a CLI command

1. Add a variant to `Commands` in `crates/sapient-cli/src/main.rs` (use `clap` derive).
2. Wire it in the `match cli.command` block in `main()`.
3. Implement the handler function in `main.rs` or a submodule (`hub.rs`, `ui.rs`, …).
4. Add `--help` text via clap doc comments on the struct fields.
5. Update `README.md` and post-install help in `install.sh` / `install.ps1` if user-facing.

Example pattern:

```rust
/// Remove one cached model from this device.
#[command(name = "rm", visible_aliases = ["remove"])]
Rm {
    /// HuggingFace model ID to remove.
    model: String,
},
```

---

## Adding a model architecture

1. **Detect architecture** in `crates/sapient-hub/src/model_info.rs` — map HF `config.json` `model_type` to `ArchType`.
2. **Add forward engine** under `crates/sapient-models/src/forward/` if native inference is supported.
3. **Register weights loading** in `crates/sapient-models/src/weights.rs`.
4. **Wire Pipeline** in `crates/sapient-generate/src/pipeline.rs`.
5. **Add tests** in `crates/sapient-models/tests/` with a tiny fixture or mocked tensors where possible.

For text-only support of vision models, document limitations in CLI output rather than failing silently.

---

## Hub and download testing

Fast downloads are controlled by `LoadOptions` and env vars (see README **Fast Downloads** section):

```bash
SAPIENT_HUB_MAX_PARALLEL=4 sapient pull <model>
SAPIENT_FAST_DOWNLOAD=0 sapient pull <model>   # sequential mode
sapient -v pull <model>                        # verbose logs + file paths
```

When debugging Hub issues:

- Check `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` for partial downloads (`.sync.part`, `.lock`).
- Use `sapient reset --stale` to clear incomplete downloads.
- Gated models require `sapient login` or `HF_TOKEN`.

---

## Releases (maintainers)

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions when a semver tag is pushed:

```bash
# 1. Bump version in root Cargo.toml (workspace.package.version)
#    and Formula/sapient.rb if needed

# 2. Commit, tag, push
git tag v0.3.2   # use actual version
git push origin main
git push origin v0.3.2
```

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds binaries for:

- macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel)
- Linux (x86_64 + aarch64)
- Windows (x86_64 + ARM64)

and attaches `install.sh` / `install.ps1` to the GitHub Release, plus the
mobile SDK artifacts (`sapient-swift.zip`, `sapient-android.zip`,
`SapientFFI.xcframework.zip` + sha256s). Post-release jobs then update the
**distribution channels** under the `openhorizon-labs` org (pushed with the
`GH_TOKEN_DIST` secret — its token must cover that org):

- `release-dist` mirrors all archives to `openhorizon-labs/sapient` (the repo
  `sapient update` reads).
- `dist-swift` re-points `openhorizon-labs/sapient-swift`'s `Package.swift`
  at the new `SapientFFI.xcframework.zip` (checksum-pinned) and tags it.
- `dist-android-maven` builds the AAR and publishes
  `so.openhorizon:sapient:<version>` into the git-hosted Maven repo
  `openhorizon-labs/sapient-android`.
- `publish-npm` publishes `@openhorizon-labs/sapient` (skips without an
  `NPM_TOKEN` secret or when the version already exists).

Install URLs in docs should point to release assets:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/SkidGod4444/sapient/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

Do **not** use `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/install.sh` in user-facing docs — the CDN can serve stale scripts.

## C++ rewrite programme (in progress)

The workspace is being ported to C++ (`cpp/`, C++20 + CMake, Clang) as a behavioural-parity conversion; the Rust `crates/` remain the correctness oracle until the port is complete. Before contributing to either tree, read `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-cpp-rewrite-design.md`:

- **Rust tree:** behaviour is frozen (bug fixes only, each mirrored in C++); do not change kernel numerics without updating the parity records.
- **C++ tree:** follow the mirroring conventions (same crate/module/test names, same env knobs, `-ffp-contract=off`, no `-march=native`), keep the SPDX header on every file, and land each change with its parity-gate result in `docs/PARITY.md`.
- **C++ build/test/lint (sub-project 0 is in):** prerequisites are CMake ≥ 3.24, Ninja and **Clang** (Apple clang, clang ≥ 16, or clang-cl on Windows — GCC/MSVC are refused unless `-DSAPIENT_ALLOW_NON_CLANG=ON`, and such builds are not parity builds). Then:

  ```bash
  cd cpp && cmake --preset dev && cmake --build --preset dev && ctest --preset dev
  just cpp-fmt      # clang-format in place (CI runs --dry-run --Werror; the pre-push hook does too)
  just cpp-lint     # SPDX header gate on cpp/ and crates/, WGSL shader-sync gate
  ```

  Kernel golden gates need dumps from the Rust oracle **made on your machine**: `just cpp-golden /tmp/sapient-golden` then `SAPIENT_GOLDEN_DIR=/tmp/sapient-golden just cpp-test`. Never commit dump files. Every new C++ source file carries the SPDX header (the `lint.spdx_headers` ctest fails otherwise), lives under `cpp/libs/sapient-<crate>/` mirroring the Rust module it ports, and every parity result goes in `docs/PARITY.md`. clang-tidy is not part of Apple's toolchain — install it with `brew install llvm` to run `run-clang-tidy` locally; otherwise the CI `cpp-lint` job runs it. Formatting and tidy are checked with clang-format/clang-tidy **18** in CI (the canonical versions); `pip install clang-format==18.1.8 clang-tidy==18.1.8` in a venv gives you the same binaries locally. When invoking `.githooks/pre-push` by hand, stage your edits first: the hook treats unstaged changes as formatter output and aborts.

## Getting help

- **Bug reports & feature requests:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SkidGod4444/sapient/issues)
- **Questions:** Open a Discussion or issue with the `question` label
- **Security issues:** Do not open public issues — contact maintainers privately

When filing a bug, include:

- OS and architecture (`uname -a` or Windows version)
- `sapient --version` output
- Full command you ran
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs (`sapient -v …` for verbose output)
